 - Histogram showing the number of clients per age interval 
 - The age of the clients have the central tendency values:
    - MEAN = 45.39
    - MEDIAN = 44
    - MODE = 48
 - Has a variance (std.dev) of 12.9
 - As the Mean and Median are close we don't have any large outliers.


  #### [CLIENT ENTITY](https://github.com/Arun-47/TARGET-AUDIENCE-REALESTATE-MARKETING-CAMPAIGN-USA/blob/main/VISUALIZATIONS/Screenshot%20(225).png)

 - A scatter plot between age and price of property bought. To find does age of the client has an impact of price of property they buy.
 - We cannot see any obvious trend. So lets calculate correlation coefficient:
      - corr.coeff = -0.19
 - As the corr.coeff below 0.2. We can say that age does the affect the price of the property the client buys.

 






## INSIGHTS
- 66% of our sales comes from California, with Navada, Colorado, Oregon forming almost 90% of the sales in US.
- Around 70% of the clients are from age of 30 to 70. With a mean of 45 and st.dev of 13 years.
- As the histogram is right skewed younger are most likely to buy property than older people
- Advertisements done on websites has a better respons from clients
- 90% of are customers are individuals
- There is no relationship between age of a customer and price they are willing to pay
